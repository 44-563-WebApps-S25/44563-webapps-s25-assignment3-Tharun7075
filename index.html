    <h2>My favorite food is chicken fried rice during my bachelors</h2> 
    <p> During my B.Tech, one of my close friends opened a new shop called <b>Ramawa restuarant.</b> They brought in chefs from Meghalaya, who were excellent cooks.
         I frequently visited the shop to enjoy their chicken fried rice, 
         which was always infused with a variety of rich flavors.  </p>

        <h4>creating tables</h4>
        <p>While Kiran Abbavaram did an excellent job in "SR Kalyanamandapam , it is always interesting to imagine how other actors might have portrayed the role. Below is a table of four actors whom I believe could have brought their own unique style and energy to the character</p>
        
        <table border="1">
            <tr>
                <th>Suggested Actor </th>
                <th>Reason for choosing</th>
                <th>Age of actor</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Nani</td>
                <td>Known for his natural acting and emotional depth, making him a great fit for the role</td>
                <td>35</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

        <h2>code snippet</h2>

        <p>This Python code snippet demonstrates how to use the sys.getsizeof() function to get the memory size of a variable.
             It assigns the value 100 to the variable a and then prints the number of bytes used by a in memory. 
             The function sys.getsizeof(a) provides the memory footprint of the object, which can help in optimizing memory usage, especially for large datasets or objects.</p>
             <pre>import sys

                a = 100;
                print(sys.getsizeof(a))</pre>
